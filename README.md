# goal-horn

looking to create a goal horn out of a raspberry pi. I already have the .py program written to play the sound and a .php program as well that calls the .py program. I have submitted what I have so far here as far as HTML code in my index.html page. I used some javascript that was given to me by a coworker. The idea is to have a locally hosted site on the pi which I access from the static IP of the pi. The website will have a button on it that when pressed executes the .php program on the raspberry pi itself.
